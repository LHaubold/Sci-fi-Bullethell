# **Sci Fi Bullet Hell** 

This project was made during my early days in game-design shool. We had procedural levelspawning over the course of two weeks and 
were supposed to create a simple game that allowed the Player to endlessly fly into one direction. This was to be achieved by
creating x number of Levelpieces that then would be randomly spawned and later on despawned after the player went through them.
I got the thing running after the first couple days so i added in some fancy graphics that were free to use as well as some extra
game mechanics. 

The player has 3 lifes, but is not onehit from everything. He can shoot, upgrade his weaponry via a powerup 
pickup or replenish health via health pickups which randomly drop from defeated enemies. Those enemies will shoot at the player who 
has to shoot them so that he can progress further without beeing killed. There is alo a simple Highscore that unfortunately is not
saved but its there so that playing doesnt feel completely pointless. Remaining lifes and health as well as the current power up
(there is only one) and the highscore are diplayed with via a UI that i build myself using Photoshop and some free to use UI graphics.

**Controls:**
- Move with WASD or the Arrow keys
- Shoot with space
- Hide UI with C
- Return to Menu with Esc (this will reset Highscore)
